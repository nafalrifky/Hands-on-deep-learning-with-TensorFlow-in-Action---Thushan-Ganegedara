    "## 1.1 What is TensorFlow?\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is an end-to-end machine learning framework originally developed at Google. It provides both **high-level APIs** (Keras) for rapid model development and **low-level primitives** for fine-grained control. TensorFlow converts model computations into optimized operations that can run efficiently on CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, and also integrates tools for monitoring and deployment (e.g., TensorBoard, SavedModel, TensorFlow Serving).\n",
    "\n",
    "Key ideas:\n",
    "- **Tensors** are the core data structures (n-dimensional arrays).\n",
    "- **Operations** (ops) transform tensors and form computation graphs.\n",
    "- **Execution modes**: eager execution for interactive development and graph mode for performance and deployment.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is intended to let you prototype quickly while offering the ability to optimize at scale when needed. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}\n",

    "## 1.2 GPU vs CPU\n",
    "\n",
    "Deep learning training relies heavily on large-scale linear algebra (matrix multiplications, convolutions). CPUs are general-purpose and excel at sequential tasks, whereas GPUs provide massive parallelism (thousands of cores) tuned for these dense numerical operations. As dataset sizes and model complexity grow, GPUs (and TPUs) provide large speedups compared to CPUs, which shortens training time and enables experimenting with larger models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Practical notes:\n",
    "- Use GPU for CNNs, Transformers, and large-batch training.\n",
    "- Use CPU for preprocessing, light inference, or small experiments where GPU overhead isn't worth it.\n",

    "## 1.3 When (and When Not) to Use TensorFlow\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is powerful, but it is not always the most appropriate tool. Use TensorFlow when you need to build and scale deep learning models, require GPU/TPU acceleration, or plan to deploy models into production with a robust pipeline. Avoid TensorFlow for small, structured datasets where classical methods (e.g., Random Forests, XGBoost, or Scikit-Learn) are faster to implement and more interpretable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quick checklist:\n",
    "- **Use TensorFlow if**: deep neural networks, large datasets, need for distributed training or production serving.\n",
    "- **Consider alternatives if**: problem is tabular with limited data, feature engineering dominates, or you need extremely quick prototype with classical methods.\n",
