    "TensorFlow is an end-to-end machine learning framework originally developed by Google Brain. It provides both high-level and low-level APIs, allowing users to build models easily using Keras or fine-tune computations using lower-level TensorFlow operations. TensorFlow supports CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, enabling scalable training.\n",
